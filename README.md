# Mobile app for Bulgarian Birds for a uni assignment

## **How it's made**

The app was made in Xamarin.Forms using .NET 6 and C#:

- [XAML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/xaml/?view=netdesktop-8.0) - Xml-based markup language;
- [MVVM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/maui/mvvm) - Model-View-ViewModel patter;
- [Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/shell/) - Reduces the complexity of mobile application development by providing the fundamental features that most mobile applications require.

## **Main functionality***

### Navigation

The navigation is done via a flyout menu on the left. The app has 2 main pages, one for Tit birds, and one for Vultures.
You can select from the available birds via a drop-down menu and then see the details about it.
The images can be made fullscreen by single tapping them, and then zoomed-in further by double-tapping.
One tap to un-zoom. Slide down to dismiss fullscreen or tap once when zoomed-out.
There is a page for the author with an image and some text. At the footer of the flyout menu you can see the current date.
